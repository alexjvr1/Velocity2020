### 1. Diversity issue

In early Oct we realised that it difficult to comparatively estimate genetic diversity in windows between the different populations. This is most likely due to different levels of missingness in the different datasets. 
While MODC and MODE have a high coverage and ~80% genotyping rate, the MUS dataset has a ~50% genotyping rate. 


*ToDo:* 

- Estimate "ground truth" diversity from reference individual which has been sequenced to high coverage. 
AJvR will download these data from the CGR servers, map back to the reference genome, and estimate global and window-based diversity

- 

### 2. Attributing Significance to Fst outliers

*ToDo:* 

- Which loci are missing in the test saf files Mark is using? 




### 3. LD estimates


### 4. Other
