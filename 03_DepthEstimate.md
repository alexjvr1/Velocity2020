# Effect of sequencing depth on various ANGSD estimates

We expect that sequencing depth is correlated with the final Genotype likelihood scores, and hence the Fst and other estimates calculated in ANGSD. 

Here I explore these relationships. 

### Estimating depth 

#### ANGSD

Sequencing depth is estimated in ANGSD in two ways: 

GlobalDepth and IndivDepth

```

```

As it is simpler to plot individual mean depth vs Fst/GL/etc, I will use depth estimates obtained directly from the bam files.

### Estimates from ANGSD to plot against depth

#### 1. Fst




#### 2. nucleotide diversity




#### 2. GL
