# Velocity2020
NERC Velocity Project analyses using Sanger genomes

Here I'll curate the variant calling pipeline and analyses undertaken using the Lepidoptera genomes generated by Sanger in 2019/2020. 


## Genome

Aphantopus hyperantus (Ringlet) was the first genome available ([NCBI link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_902806685.1)), so the pipeline will be set up with this species. 

## WGS

Whole genome resequencing data was generated for 38 & 40 modern individuals (sampled 2016-2017 & 2019) from a core and expanding population. Museum data was generated from 48 individuals + resequencing of a subset of individuals to increase read coverage. 

## Note on renaming files

Liverpool raw data is named with digits and a dash before the sample names. e.g. 33-AH-01-1900-47_191121_L001_R2.fastq.gz
The easiest way to rename them is with the Perl rename (note that the native linux rename works the same as mv and is not so useful in this case). 
Install the perl script (a version curated [here](https://github.com/subogero/rename)). On bluecp3 I've installed this in my software folder: /newhome/aj18951/software/rename-master/rename.

This works with the sed syntax. e.g. this will remove numbers plus dash from the start of the file names: 

../../software/rename-master/rename 's/^[0-9]+-//' *

## Pipeline

### 1. Demultiplex and Adapter trimming

Modern samples arrive demultiplexed by the sequencing facility, but Museum samples need to be demultiplexed. 

### 2. Map to Reference Genome

### 3. MapDamage: correct for Cytosine deamination in museum data

#### 3a. MapDamage run on museum data

#### 3b. Downsample modern data to the same coverage as in the museum samples


### 4. ANGSD

#### 4a. Set up filters (including min and maxDepth)

#### 4b. Call GL

#### 4c. SFS

#### 4d. Compare downsampled data to full dataset for modern pops (SFS and GL)

#### 4e. Population structure (PCA)

#### 4f. Diversity stats 

#### 4g. Outliers

#### 4h. LD analyses


### 5. Map outlier loci

Map outlier loci, identify candidates in the area

Synteny between modern and museum samples.
