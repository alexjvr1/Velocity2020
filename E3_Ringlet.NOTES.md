# Ringlet info and meeting notes


Papers to look at: 

Schl√∂tterer lab - Experimental evol: segregating polymorphisms in base. No repeat solutions. 


## Main question

How much selection has there been in space and time? 

- Direction

- Strength

- Associations (fxn)

- Similarity between datasets?

## Samples

Mus samples collected between 1900-1930, so this is not one population. Implications for pop gen estimates? 

Core Salisbury

Exp Cairngorm

## Wolbachia

Wolbachia sweep since 1900. i.e. Wolbachia has spread across the modern populations but low prevalence in museum samples. 

Chance that changes in the nuclear genome = adaptation to wolbachia? e.g. immunity in males

Stef will prioritise this analysis for the paper. 

## Planned analyses

### Checks

1. Fst vs depth

2. Nucleotide diversity vs depth

3. Global depth per locus



### Diversity and population structure

1. nuc div: nr SNPs/nr Bases

2. ROH - but will this work for the museum data? 

3. Tajima's D in windows

4. PCAngsd

5. Global Fst (excluding the sex chromosome)

### Outliers

1. Fst in windows - just take the tail

** How will we add significance to these? 

### Selection 

- How much selection overall? e.g. Petri formula (used by Nick Barton)

Recombination rate x selection coefficient combining p-values

Rs as fxn of Fst

** See ABC selection MS (Beaumont and Bazza - islands of differentiation) 

- Direction, strength and fxn of selection? 

*Table:

Chr/pos | outlier | comparison (1=MODC-MUC, 2=MODC-MODE, 3=MUS-MODE) | Direction for 1,2,3 | Function

- Balancing selection

complementary deletions, inversions, Het advantage? Need LD tests for this

- Z-chromosome

Analyse independently

eg. circadian clock genes, period genes. 

### Function of outliers

Sam will work on this

#### 1. Hub genes

Modularity - e.g. cortex genes

Adaptation through large steps ff by refinements in selection? 

#### 2. Set of candidate genes e.g. pesticide and temp related




### LD vs FST

Sam will run this

Need chromosome level genotype likelihoods


### Candidate adaptive loci 


### Demographic analyses

History: 

- rapid expansion. 

1976 - 2014; 76% increase in occupancy

One of the most extreme cases in Callum's Nature comms paper (most rapid expansion) 

Emergence time 2 days earlier per decade

Voltanism? 

- No distribution in the NW? Why declined? 

- most likely mix of expanding and infilling

- request distribution records to see change in distribution (Callum use these, but we'll need a new request. Or see Callum's paper)


#### To do

estimate Ne for all 3 populations

fastSimCoal2 for change in pop size? 

e.g. pathway analyses Excoffier et al.
